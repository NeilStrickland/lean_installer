 <h1>Lean installer for Windows</h1>

 From this page you can download a Windows installer that installs the
 Lean proof assistant together with various other things that are
 needed to use it effectively.

 In more detail, it attempts to do the following: 
 <ul>
  <li>Install Git for Windows.  (This is needed to install the
  mathlib library, which is required for almost any serious project.
  Most other Lean libraries are also distributed using Git.)</li>
  <li>Install Elan and Lean.  (Elan is a system whose main purpose is
  to manage multiple projects that might need different versions of
  Lean and/or mathlib, but in fact it is convenient even if you only
  have one version.) 
  </li>
  <li>Install VS Code.  (This is an editor/developement
  environment with intelligent support for software development in a
   wide range of languages.) </li>
  <li>Install the Lean extension for VS Code.  (This allows us to
  write proofs in VS Code and get Lean to check them in real time.)
  </li>
  <li>Set up a project folder containing some sample files together
  with a copy of mathlib.  For a user named Alice, this project folder
  will be C:\Users\Alice\Lean\Sandbox, with the sample files in
  Sandbox\src and the library in Sandbox\_target\deps\mathlib. 
  </li>
  <li>Start up VS Code, and open the project folder.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <br/><br/>
 This is a very preliminary version of an installer.  Some potential
 issues are as follows:
 <ul>
  <li>
   There is not much error-checking, and not many configuration
   options. 
  </li>
  <li>
   We install the system version of VS Code in C:\Program Files.  For
   some reason, the VS Code developers encourage people to install the
   user version in C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Local\Programs instead, even
   though that is not at all standard for other applications of
   similar type.  We need privilege escalation in order to install
   Git, and that creates problems with the user version of VS Code, so
   we have chosen the system version instead.
  </li>
  <li>
   VS Code wants to open itself after it has installed.  We do not
   want it to open until we have installed the Lean extension and the
   sample files.  The installer configuration is supposed to sort this
   out, but it does not seem to work consistently.
  </li>
  <li>
   We have not yet arranged for the user to see or accept license
   information. 
  </li>
 </ul>
